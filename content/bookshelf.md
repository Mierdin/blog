I am a big fan of Audible for books. Every once in a while I have time and patience to read
a physical book, but often times I find myself needing to do things like washing dishes,
going on a long walk or drive, and Audible has made it so much easier for me to get back into
"reading".

Since I started doing this, I'd like to share the books that I've been able to get through this
way. I do occassionally listen to/read fiction, etc but for this list I'm focusing on books for professional
development or IT process improvement. I also don't include references, like books on Python, Go, networking, systems
etc, though my physical bookshelf is quite full of those.
