I woke up this morning and realized that I had broken my 3-week long streak of blog posting, where I had gotten in the habit of making a new post nearly every day of the week. Since I have been unemployed for the past three weeks and my primary priority was to study for the CCNP, it was easy to come up with new blog content at a relatively rapid pace.

I have recently taken a position with a Cisco partner that allows me to work with a lot of new Cisco gear, as well as replacing or integrating with other vendors equipment, such as HP. I get to work with a very diverse customer base, both geographically, and with respect to the networks being used, which means that I'm going to have a much greater exposure to network technologies, both old and new. This means I'll be able to have much more content to offer the blogosphere, as I'll be touching new technology nearly every day. Unfortunately, this also means I will probably not have the amount of time I did before when I really had all the time in the world to dedicate to GNS3 labs and blogging about it.

My promise to you is this: I fully intend to dedicate time and effort into Keeping It Classless as per the original intent for the site, which has and always will be to document my explorations into the computer networking industry. I have really been amazed by the success the blog has had in recent weeks and I want to continue to grow the site into something useful.Â I think the new opportunities set before me are extremely valuable, and I intend to share what I can in this format. I do, however, now have other priorities, and in order to keep myself sharp and satisfy my other commitments, I probably won't be able to keep up the breakneck pace I seem to have set for myself. That said, I will be working towards a somewhat regulated pace of posting new content, and I have all the confidence in the world that the end result will be better content for you, the reader.

Thank you for your understanding, and as always, keep it classless.
