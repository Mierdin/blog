It's been a while since I've done a review of anything on the site and since I'd rather continue to make use of the category than delete it, I decided to share a piece of software I recently discovered that's helping make my life easier.

Remote Desktop Connection Manager is essentially just that - it manages remote desktop connections. However, it does it in a way that I find appealing and EASIER to use than the native client or other organizational methods out there.

Remote Desktop Connection Manager (affectionately referred to as RDCMan) displays all your saved connections to the left in a hierarchical format that allows you to create really detailed (and nested) organizational units to store your connections. It is SUPER familiar for someone like me who uses the popular SecureCRT for SSH/Telnet/Serial etc connections, which approaches this in a similar fashion.

There are quite a few customization options - everything that's normally available to you int the native client is included here, plus a lot more. I noticed that there's an option to use multiple monitors when needed. I am not currently in a place to test this, but I certainly will when I can.

It's also handy to use for keeping resolutions in check - the default option is to use the resolution of the viewing box on the client PC - no need to re-size, though you can go full-screen whenever you want, of course.

I give this one a thumbs up - super useful, and unlike Microsoft's usual MO, VERY lightweight - the installer is well under 1MB!

You can download RDCMan here:
