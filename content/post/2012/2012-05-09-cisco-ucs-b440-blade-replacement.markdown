Cisco announced recently a replacement program for their B440 blades (M1 and M2)

Something I noticed on the front of each blade, where the model is shown, the new generation blades (replacements) have the black background with the silver text, shown as the top blade on the picture below:

However, the old blades still have the black text with no background. An interesting way to identify the newer generation of hardware.

> I know the B200 M3 series came out recently, anyone know if these have this feature, or if they follow the "old school" labels?

In any case, thanks for replacing these blades for me Cisco, and helping to prevent my datacenter from burning down!
