I am happy to say that I have officially started putting things together for my CCIE R/S studies. I have been and will continue to be pulled in many different directions, but since my CCNP was completed a few months ago, and I recently passed my VCP exam, I decided  that the time was now to begin the long journey ahead. I have a few other certifications in mind, and I will have to carefully weigh how they impact (or preferably do not impact) my CCIE studies, but this journey is important to me personally and professionally, so I'm pulling the trigger.

I will be posting anything related to my CCIE studies under the new category "My CCIE Journey".

> EDIT: This category may not exist any more, since I took my career in a different direction in the following years.

For now, I wanted to share the list of books I just purchased.
	
  1.  Cisco LAN Switching
  2. Routing TCP/IP Volume 1
  3. Routing TCP/IP Volume 2
  4. "CCIE Routing and Switching Certification Guide" by Wendell Odom
  5. "Cisco QoS Exam Certification Guide" by Wendell Odom
  6. "NX-OS and Cisco Nexus Switching"

I purchased that last one, "NX-OS and Cisco Nexus Switching" as a sort of guilty pleasure that will help keep my brain, which will be oriented towards pure Route/Switch during these studies, in the DC realm, bridging the two worlds together for me mentally. Like I said, I am pulled in many different directions these days.

Regardless, this will prove to be an exciting ride, and I look forward to documenting and sharing my experiences.
