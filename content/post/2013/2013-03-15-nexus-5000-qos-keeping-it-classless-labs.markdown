I'm pleased to revive the KIC LABS series with a video on Cisco MQC-style QoS on the Nexus 5000.

**PLEASE** read these two articles first, as they do a lot better job at explaining the structure that we're going to be putting together in the video. Unfortunately I was not able to provide this during the video, as I was pressed for time.

This is a rather informal video but I hope you enjoy it! I had to re-record the audio after the video was captured because the environment I was in for the video was very noisy. I encourage you to leave your comments below and let me know how I can improve future videos!
