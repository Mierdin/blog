This is a video on some of the "nerd knobs" that we get to play with in a traditional spanning tree environment.

I have done [a full writeup](https://oswalt.dev/2013/06/ccie-spanning-tree-part-1-nerd-knobs/) on the topic that goes along with this video - you can view this video on that page as well.
