My time lately has been just blasted. I'm being placed into new projects with a large company that involves just about every technology found in a datacenter, and as a result, my spare time is....nonexistent.

My knowledge levels in many areas continues to increase, and my need to spew some of it onto the internet in the form of helpful posts, or opinions is not quenched, but unfortunately I do not have a ton of time to dedicate to full-on blog posts during the week. As a result, I will be posting blog posts in smaller form when I feel the need to share a helpful hint or command, just without the large paragraph opinion or explanation.

The navigation bar near the top contains a link called "KIClets". Please click this link to see this category of posts. Hopefully this will allow me to continue to post somewhat frequently, and continue to share some of the things I pick up here and there.

As always, feel free to share your comments and thoughts below. Thanks!
