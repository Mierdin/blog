The majority of these files are copied from the anatole theme layouts with minimal changes, including:

- Removing `animated fadeInDown` classes in various places because it is really annoying
- Adding category tag to post list
- Moving category/tag to top of post

I also removed the feed.xml file so as to use Hugo's built-in one.
