<h2>Not affiliated with Vendors, Employers, Customers, Etc.</h2>
Nothing I write about on this blog should be viewed to reflect any opinion of any employer, past or present. I write for myself and myself alone. I do not make it a practice to disclose the details of any technology implementation without express permission, whether it is an employer (past or present) or a customer, or any other organization. Details provided on this blog should not be perceived to reflect the actual design or configuration of any technology or infrastructure deployment, unless otherwise explicitly stated.

I write about what interests me - some of the tools and technologies that I write about may be used in existing deployments, but I also write about other things as well. This blog is simply an exploration of these experiences in a generic way that you, the reader, can learn about these concepts and find a way to integrate them into your own day-to-day experiences.

Any sharing or re-sharing of content (i.e. Twitter retweets/favorites, link posting, etc.) is not an endorsement or acknowledgement of any kind, just an indication that I feel a topic warrants further scrutiny and/or discussion)

<h2>Blog with Integrity</h2>

<img src="http://www.blogwithintegrity.com/badges/BWI_150sq.jpg" alt="BlogWithIntegrity.com" border="0" /> 

<p>I believe strongly in blogging with integrity. I have signed <a href="http://www.blogwithintegrity.com/" target="_blank">the pledge</a>, and I believe in everything it says.</p>

While I may go back from time to time and correct small typographical errors in past posts, I do not believe in revisionist writing. I started this blog because I wanted to document my learning experiences, and when I write something, it is what it is. Any writing, negative or positive, about vendors or their products, are my opinion, and mine alone. No vendor or employer, past or present, or any other organization, has any influence whatsoever in what I write, and I don't speak for anyone but myself. When I write about a product or vendor, it's because I felt strongly about it in some way that I was compelled to share with the public on my own.

One of my leading goals for my career is to remain objective, and get down to the nitty-gritty details of whatever technology I work with. Each of my employers thus far have been diverse in their vendor partnerships, and it is my goal to keep it that way. I always value the diversity and generalization of technology so that common ground can be found. This is why I got into networking in the first place; at the end of the day, standards-based protocols must be used somewhere.  I write about these technologies because they're in front of me, begging to be analyzed. That's all I want to do.
<h2>Tech Field Day</h2>
From time to time, I may also attend events such as those organized <a href="http://techfieldday.com/about/">by Gestalt IT</a>. These events are sponsored by networking vendors who thus indirectly cover our travel costs. In addition to a presentation (or more), vendors may give us a tasty unicorn burger, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQrJk9JzW8o">warm sweater made from presenter's beard</a> or a similar tchotchke. The vendors sponsoring Tech Field Day events don't ask for, nor are they promised any kind of consideration in the writing of my blog posts ... and as always, all opinions expressed here are entirely my own and not those of sponsoring vendors, my employer and/or its affiliates, and all the mistakes are my fault. If I write about something, it's because I felt compelled to do so - simple as that.
